# gas_leakage_detection
So the idea is quite simple, yet useful.
Making a gas detector that can detect smoke(in case of fire) and LPG/Natural gas leak from kitchen and warn the owner of potential hazard via both alarm and text message or voicemail.
Detector is too small enough to be hanged to the kitchen wall without taking much space.
It is a small weekend project and can be completed in a day if materials are available and ready.
